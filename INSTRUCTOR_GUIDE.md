## üïê Lesson Structure (Recommended: 2-3 hours)

### Phase 1: Introduction (20 minutes)
- **Objective**: Set context and motivate the problem
- **Activities**:
  - Discuss real-world applications of fuel efficiency prediction
  - Introduce the dataset and features
  - Run the demo script (`python demo.py`)
- **Key Points**:
  - ML is about finding patterns in data
  - Regression predicts continuous values
  - Features are input variables, target is what we predict

### Phase 2: Data Exploration (30 minutes)
- **Objective**: Understand the importance of data analysis
- **Activities**:
  - Run the main script (`python fuel_efficiency_predictor.py`)
  - Examine the exploratory data analysis section
  - Discuss correlations and feature relationships
- **Key Points**:
  - Always explore data before modeling
  - Correlation doesn't imply causation
  - Visualizations help understand patterns

### Phase 3: Model Training (40 minutes)
- **Objective**: Learn the ML training process
- **Activities**:
  - Explain train/test split concept
  - Discuss why we scale features
  - Compare Linear Regression vs Random Forest
- **Key Points**:
  - Training data teaches the model
  - Test data evaluates performance
  - Different algorithms have different strengths

### Phase 4: Model Evaluation (30 minutes)
- **Objective**: Understand how to measure model quality
- **Activities**:
  - Interpret R¬≤, RMSE, and MAE metrics
  - Analyze prediction vs actual plots
  - Discuss feature importance
- **Key Points**:
  - Higher R¬≤ is better (closer to 1.0)
  - Lower RMSE/MAE is better
  - Feature importance shows what matters most

### Phase 5: Interactive Exploration (30 minutes)
- **Objective**: Hands-on experimentation
- **Activities**:
  - Launch Streamlit app (`streamlit run streamlit_app.py`)
  - Let students experiment with predictions
  - Try different car configurations
- **Key Points**:
  - Models can predict on new, unseen data
  - Extreme values may give unrealistic predictions
  - Model limitations and assumptions

### Phase 6: Extensions (20 minutes)
- **Objective**: Encourage further learning
- **Activities**:
  - Introduce student exercises
  - Discuss next steps in ML journey
  - Show real-world applications

## üéØ Assessment Ideas

### Formative Assessment
- **Quick Checks**: Ask students to predict which features are most important
- **Think-Pair-Share**: Discuss why we split data into train/test sets
- **Exit Ticket**: One thing learned, one question remaining

### Summative Assessment Options

#### Option 1: Prediction Challenge
- Give students new car specifications
- Ask them to predict MPG using both models
- Discuss why predictions might differ

#### Option 2: Feature Analysis
- Ask students to identify the top 3 most important features
- Explain why these features matter for fuel efficiency
- Suggest a new feature that might improve predictions

#### Option 3: Model Comparison
- Compare Linear Regression vs Random Forest
- When would you choose each algorithm?
- What are the trade-offs?

#### Option 4: Real-World Application
- Choose another domain (house prices, stock prices, etc.)
- Identify relevant features
- Discuss how the same approach would apply

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation Problems
- **Issue**: Package installation fails
- **Solution**: Use virtual environment, update pip
- **Command**: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

### Visualization Issues
- **Issue**: Plots don't display
- **Solution**: Install appropriate backend
- **Command**: `pip install matplotlib`

### Streamlit Problems
- **Issue**: Streamlit won't start
- **Solution**: Check port availability
- **Command**: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502`

## üìä Expected Results

Students should see:
- **Linear Regression R¬≤**: ~0.83
- **Random Forest R¬≤**: ~0.76
- **Most Important Features**: displacement, cylinders, horsepower
- **Prediction Range**: 10-35 MPG for typical cars

## üöÄ Extensions and Modifications
